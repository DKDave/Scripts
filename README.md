# My scripts

This is my collection of various QuickBMS and Noesis scripts I've written for extracting data from many game archives, covering multiple platforms.

I have previously uploaded many of these to websites such as Xentax, Zenhax, and also Xentax/HCS discord channels.  The ones published here have been corrected/updated where required, so these should be the most complete versions.

Many more scripts will be added once checked for accuracy.
