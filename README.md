# My scripts

This is my collection of various QuickBMS, Python and Noesis scripts I've written for extracting data from many game archives, covering multiple platforms.

I have previously uploaded many of these to websites such as Xentax, Zenhax, and also Xentax/HCS discord channels, and there are many that haven't been previously uploaded elsewhere.  The ones published here have been corrected/updated where required, so these should be the most complete versions and will replace any previous versions.

Many more scripts will be added once checked for accuracy.

NOTE: These scripts are all my own work based on my own reverse engineering.  You may not distribute these tools for profit in any way, and all credit to me must be given if redistributed/re-used in your own projects.

NOTE 2: The latest version of QuickBMS (0.12) may not work correctly with some scripts due to differences in string handling.
